Untitled 2 Player Co-op Demon Summoning Game

Randomly generated rich person's spooky house with one special, bigger, demon-summoning room
Each player can move around the house freely, top down view

The players' goal is to summon a demon to destroy the house
To do this, they need to locate key items within the house and bring them to the summoning room
Once they've collected all the items, they must both be in the room to complete the ritual and win

Impeding the players are little demons which are out to kill them
One of the players must always be carrying THE BOOK which attracts all the demons
If the book or either player is touched by a demon, the players LOSE
